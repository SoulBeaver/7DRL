# Cave generation

# I'm using a cellular automata described here: http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels
# The algorithm repeatedly loops over the map, filling in walls depending on a certain set of rules
# These rules can be adjusted to change the appearance of the cave

# Probability of creating a wall on the first pass
wallCreationProbability: 40
# Requirement to remain a wall for every successive pass
neighborsRequiredToRemainAWall: 4
# Requirement to becomea wall for every successive pass
neighborsRequiredToCreateAWall: 5
# Number of passes. Each pass will (hopefully) smooth out the map
numberOfPasses: 5
