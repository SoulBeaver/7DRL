Arena

Welcome to my submission for the 7DRL, or the [Seven Day Roguelike Challenge](http://7drl.roguetemple.com/)!

My Roguelike was entered on the 9th and completed on the 17th of March! The project is classified as a failure, but a
very enjoyable and enlightening failure. For a dissertation and step-by-step posts on how I built my Arena roguelike,
[please see my thread](http://forums.roguetemple.com/index.php?topic=3933.0).

Lore
====

The Arena. A massive pit of grime and violence. The walls are splattered with the blood of challengers and losers, those
unable to withstand the pressure of combat. Their rendered bodies are the trophies of the victors- Bosses. These
terrifying creatures dare any mortal to challenge them on one-to-many combat. There will be one of you, many of them,
and suffering to be enjoyed for all!

Welcome to the Arena.
